This assignment requires you to demonstrate an understanding of the topics in Lesson 1 - Classwork lab (1) and (2) by updating the Statue of Liberty webpage (from Lesson 1
Assignment) as follows:

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Add 3 links vertically to the LINKS area (on the left side) of the liberty.html webpage.
    a. Name the first link FACTS. The HTML link code should point to facts.html
    b. Name the second link GALLERY. The HTML link code should point to
    gallery.html.
    c. Name the third link VIDEO. The HTML link code should point to video.html.
2. Duplicate your liberty.html file. Rename the new file facts.html.
3. Duplicate your liberty.html file again. Rename the new file gallery.html.
4. Duplicate your liberty.html file. Rename the new file video.html.
5. Make sure that when the FACTS link is clicked, it opens up the facts.html webpage.
Repeat for GALLERY and VIDEO.
6. For the facts.html webpage, replace all the right-side content (Overview, Appearance
etc.), with a table similar to enhance.html. The table should contain basic facts (in a
table format) about the Statue of Liberty.
7. Similar to STEP 6, in the gallery.html webpage, on the right side, include the use of
content similar to concept.html and olist.html. Make sure to use images and information
related to the Statue of Liberty.
8. Similar to STEP 6, in the video.html webpage, on the right side, include the use of
content similar to video.html. Make sure to use videos and information related to the
Statue of Liberty.
9. Notice you have not linked to the liberty.html webpage. That is your home page. Create
one more link named HOME that will point to the liberty.html webpage.


When you are done, your Statue of Liberty webpage will include 4 links to all pages of your
website: liberty.html, facts.html, gallery.html and video.html. All pages will be identical
except for the right-side content area which will be different on all pages.
Check all links to be sure you can navigate across the website and back successfully.
